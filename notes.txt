Chairperson Dashboard:

After logging in, the Chairperson is directed to their dashboard, where they can:
Register the group name (for the welfare group).
View or manage members.
Assign roles to the members of the group.
Example Workflow:
Step 1: Chairperson registers their account (personal info, username, password).
Step 2: Chairperson logs in with username/password.
Step 3: On the dashboard, the Chairperson registers the Chama Welfare Group (group name, description, etc.).
Step 4: The Chairperson can add members to the group and assign roles within the group from the dashboard.
This approach keeps things clean, logical, and more manageable, especially as you expand the app's functionality.

Would you like help with building the Group Registration Form in the dashboard or need any further clarification on this process?
